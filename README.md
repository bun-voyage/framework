## Overview

Welcome to **Bun Voyage**! This is an open-source project that presents a unique combination: a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) framework and an accompanying game, both developed simultaneously. Here, we provide an overview of the project, its goals, and its current status.

## Project Status

**⚠️ Early Development Stage:** Bun Voyage is in the early stages of development. We are actively building both a CQRS framework and a game example in tandem. While we have achieved some initial functionality, both components are works in progress. Expect continuous updates and improvements as we expand the capabilities of both the framework and the game.

## Features

- **CQRS Framework:** Bun Voyage provides the groundwork for implementing CQRS architecture in your applications, allowing for a clean separation of commands and queries.
- **Game Example:** As part of our development journey, we are creating a sample game using the Bun Voyage CQRS framework. This example serves as a practical demonstration of how the framework can be applied in a real-world context.
